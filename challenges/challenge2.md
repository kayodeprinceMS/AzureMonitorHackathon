## Challenge 2:  Activity Logs and Update Management

**Activity Logs** are everything happening to your resources on the API level. The Activity log is a platform log in Azure that provides insights into subscription-level events. This includes information such as when a resource is modified or when a virtual machine is started.

### Main Objective:
Understand Activity Logs and configure an Alert to get notified if a VM has been turned off.
Understand how to configure Azure Update Management and how to keep your VMs up-to-date.

### Tasks to finish the Challenge
- Start / Stop a VM
- Check the Activity Logs to see the events of starting or stopping a VM
- Create an Alert for the Visual Studio VM to be notified if the VM has been stopped
- Stop the VM, and see if you got the Alert
- Use Azure Update Management to keep your VMs up-to-date on a daily basis.

#### Bonus question/task:
- Will the Alert get fired if the VM was turned off from the OS? Or if the VM was not available? Why?
- Can you use Azure Update Management to install just one specific patch?

### Definition of Done:
Show the Alert which got fired and explain what you have done.
